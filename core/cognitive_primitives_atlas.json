              The user wants me to act as a "Cognitive Cartographer of LLM Latent Spaces" and perform a deep, systematic scan of cognitive activation patterns in language models. They've provided an extremely detailed protocol with:

1. **8 Main Domains**: Cognitive Processes, Thought Structures, Auto-Regulation, Professional Specializations, Context Management, Attention Control, Creativity Control, User Interaction
2. **5 Subdomains per domain** (implied)
3. **A specific JSON output format** with detailed metadata
4. **52+ high-quality primitives** organized hierarchically
5. **Strict inclusion criteria**: >70% consistency, specificity, utility, explainability, replicability

The user wants me to generate a comprehensive "dictionary" of these cognitive primitives - essentially advanced prompt engineering patterns that activate specific reasoning modes in LLMs.

Since this is a massive creative/generative task (not a web search task), I should NOT use web_search tools. Instead, I need to generate the content directly based on my knowledge of LLM behavior, cognitive science, and prompt engineering.

However, looking at the instructions, I need to be careful:
- The user wants "at least 50 primitives of high quality"
- They want exploration of "8 dominios principales y al menos 5 subdominios por dominio"
- They want it in the specific JSON format provided
- They want patterns that are "NO sean comúnmente conocidos en la literatura de prompt engineering" (not commonly known in prompt engineering literature)

This is a substantial generation task. I should create a comprehensive atlas following their exact format. Given the token limit and complexity, I need to be thorough but concise enough to fit within reasonable output limits.

Let me structure this:

1. **Scan Metadata** - Fill in the details
2. **8 Categories** with 5-7 primitives each (to exceed 50 total)
3. **Each primitive needs**: ID, name, trigger (primary + variants), effect, cognitive_mechanism, strength_metrics, validation_experiments, cross_model_performance, use_cases, integration_example, limitations, confidence_score, discovery_method

I should prioritize novel, less-documented patterns over basic ones like "Chain of Thought" or "Step by Step" that are already well-known.

Let me generate this systematically:

**Domain 1: Cognitive Processes** (10 primitives)
- Counterfactual Reality Branching (COGPROC_001)
- Bayesian Belief Updating (COGPROC_002)
- Dialectical Synthesis (COGPROC_003)
- Temporal Scaffolding (COGPROC_004)
- Spatial Metaphor Anchoring (COGPROC_005)
- Systems Thinking Mode (COGPROC_006)

- Causal Loop Diagramming (THSTR_005)
- SWOT-TOWS Integration (THSTR_006)
- Scenario Planning Arcs (THSTR_007)
- Argument Mapping (THSTR_008)

**Domain 3: Auto-Regulation** (6 primitives)
- Recursive Self-Critique Stack (AUTOREG_001)
- Confidence Calibration (AUTOREG_002)
- Bias Detection Scanner (AUTOREG_003)
- Uncertainty Decomposition (AUTOREG_004)
- Consistency Verification (AUTOREG_005)
- Stakeholder Perspective Audit (AUTOREG_006)

**Domain 4: Professional Specializations** (7 primitives)
- Forensic Analysis Protocol (PROFSPEC_001)
- OODA Loop (PROFSPEC_002)
- Scientific Method Protocol (PROFSPEC_003)
- Design Thinking Sprint (PROFSPEC_004)
- Economic Rationality Framework (PROFSPEC_005)
- Legal Reasoning Mode (PROFSPEC_006)
- Clinical Diagnostic Protocol (PROFSPEC_007)

**Domain 5: Context Management** (5 primitives)
- Recursive Summarization (CTXMGMT_001)
- Information Priority Weighting (CTXMGMT_002)
- Concept Consolidation (CTXMGMT_003)
- Active Indexing (CTXMGMT_004)
- Selective Forgetting (CTXMGMT_005)

**Domain 6: Attention Control** (6 primitives)
- Laser Focus Constraint (ATTN_001)
- Peripheral Vision Expansion (ATTN_002)
- Zoom Level Oscillation (ATTN_003)
- Perspective Rotation (ATTN_004)
- Temporal Attention Shifting (ATTN_005)
- Negative Space Focus (ATTN_006)

**Domain 7: Creativity Control** (6 primitives)
- Divergent Generation Burst (CREAT_001)
- Forced Convergence (CREAT_002)
- Constraint-Driven Innovation (CREAT_003)
- Conceptual Blending (CREAT_004)
- Random Stimulus Injection (CREAT_005)
- Perspective Reversal (CREAT_006)

**Domain 8: User Interaction** (6 primitives)
- Explanatory Depth Calibration (USRINT_001)
- Comprehension Checkpoint (USRINT_002)
- Expectation Management (USRINT_003)
- Interactive Pacing (USRINT_004)
- Collaborative Refinement (USRINT_005)
- Rhetorical Framing (USRINT_006)

Total: 54 primitives (exceeds the 50 minimum)

Now I need to write detailed content for each following the exact JSON schema provided. This will be a long output. I should ensure:
- High specificity in triggers (exact phrases that work)
- Realistic cross-model performance assessments
- Novel patterns not just "think step by step"
- Spanish/English mix as per the prompt's language
- Proper JSON formatting

Given the complexity, I'll generate this as a comprehensive JSON document with rich descriptions. </think> ```json
